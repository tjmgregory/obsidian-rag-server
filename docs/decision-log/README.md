# Decision Log

## Purpose
This directory contains architectural decisions and important technical choices made during the development of the Obsidian RAG plugin. Each decision is documented to provide context for future development and help new contributors understand why certain approaches were chosen.

## Format
Each day's decisions are logged in a single file with the naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-summary-of-content.md
```

## For AI Agents
When making important technical decisions:
1. Check this directory for existing decisions on similar topics
2. Add new decisions to today's file (create if doesn't exist)
3. Update the filename to reflect the content summary
4. If multiple decisions exist for one day, combine them in the summary

## Structure
Each decision should include:
- **Context**: What problem or choice prompted this decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was chosen
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **Decision Maker**: Who made the decision
- **Review Date**: When to revisit this decision
