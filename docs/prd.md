## MCP Server Implementation

### Server Specification (Following MCP Standards)

#### Server Metadata
- **Name**: `obsidian-rag` (lowercase, hyphenated, under 128 chars)
- **Version**: `0.1.0` (semantic versioning)
- **Description**: "Model Context Protocol server for Obsidian RAG - provides semantic search and knowledge retrieval from Obsidian vaults"
- **Transport**: STDIO (local) with future HTTP+SSE support
- **Capabilities**: Tools, Resources, and Prompts

### MCP Tools (verb-oriented, perform actions)

#### `search_vault`
**Description**: "Perform semantic search across the Obsidian vault using natural language queries. This tool understands the meaning and intent behind your search, not just keywords. It searches through all note content, titles, and metadata to find conceptually related information. The search considers synonyms, related concepts, and semantic similarity to return the most relevant notes even if they don't contain the exact search terms. Results are ranked by relevance with contextual snippets showing why each note matched. This is the primary tool for discovering information when you don't know the exact note location or when you want to find all related content on a topic."

#### `get_note`
**Description**: "Retrieve the complete content of a specific note from the vault when you know its exact path. This tool returns the full markdown content including frontmatter metadata, tags, links, and all formatting. Use this when you need to read an entire note for detailed analysis, when you want to understand the full context of a piece of information, or when you need to work with the complete content of a known note. The tool preserves all markdown formatting, code blocks, and embedded content exactly as stored in the vault."

#### `list_notes`
**Description**: "Browse and explore the vault's contents by listing notes with various filtering options. This tool helps you understand the vault's structure, discover what topics are covered, and find notes by their location, tags, or modification time. It's particularly useful for getting an overview of specific folders (like Projects or Areas in PARA method), finding recently updated notes to understand current work, or discovering all notes with certain tags. Unlike search, this tool doesn't look at content but rather at note metadata and organization."

#### `analyze_connections`
**Description**: "Explore the knowledge graph by analyzing how notes are connected through links, backlinks, and semantic relationships. This tool reveals the network of ideas in your vault by traversing connections between notes, identifying clusters of related content, and finding hidden relationships that aren't explicitly linked. It helps you understand how different concepts relate to each other, discover authoritative notes that many others reference, and find gaps in your knowledge graph. The analysis goes beyond simple links to identify semantic similarities and topic clusters, making it invaluable for understanding the deeper structure of your knowledge base."

#### `extract_context`
**Description**: "Build comprehensive, optimized context about any topic by intelligently gathering and organizing relevant information from across the vault. This tool doesn't just search for notes; it constructs a coherent narrative by finding all relevant pieces of information, organizing them logically, removing redundancy, and presenting them in a format optimized for AI consumption. It understands the relationships between different pieces of information and assembles them into a unified context that fits within token limits while preserving the most important details. Use this when you need to provide an AI with complete background on a complex topic or when preparing comprehensive briefings."

### MCP Resources (noun-oriented, provide data)

#### `obsidian://vault/info`
**Description**: "Comprehensive metadata and statistics about the entire Obsidian vault that provides a high-level understanding of the knowledge base. This resource returns information about the vault's size, structure, age, and activity patterns including total note count, word count, tag usage, folder organization, creation and modification dates, and growth trends. It helps AI assistants understand the scope and nature of the knowledge base they're working with, enabling them to provide more contextual responses and better gauge the depth of available information on various topics."

#### `obsidian://vault/tags`
**Description**: "Complete taxonomy of all tags used throughout the vault, providing insight into the topics, themes, and organizational structure of your knowledge. This resource returns not just a list of tags but their usage frequency, hierarchical relationships (nested tags), and distribution patterns. It helps identify the main topics you write about, understand your organizational system, find related concepts through tag proximity, and discover potential areas for further exploration. The tag structure often reveals the mental model and categorization system used in the vault."

#### `obsidian://vault/recent`
**Description**: "A chronological view of recently created and modified notes that reveals current interests, active projects, and work patterns. This resource provides insights into what you're currently thinking about and working on, making it invaluable for maintaining continuity in your work, identifying emerging themes, and ensuring recent insights are connected to existing knowledge. It helps AI assistants understand the temporal context of your work and prioritize recent developments when providing assistance."

#### `obsidian://vault/graph`
**Description**: "The complete knowledge graph structure showing how all notes in the vault are interconnected through explicit links, backlinks, and semantic relationships. This resource provides a bird's-eye view of your knowledge architecture, revealing clusters of related content, central hub notes that connect many concepts, isolated notes that might need integration, and the overall topology of your ideas. It's essential for understanding not just what information exists but how different pieces of knowledge relate to and build upon each other."

#### `obsidian://vault/folders`
**Description**: "The hierarchical folder structure of the vault that reveals the organizational methodology (such as PARA, Zettelkasten, or custom systems) used to categorize and store notes. This resource helps understand the high-level categories of information, the distinction between different types of content (projects vs resources vs archives), the depth and breadth of coverage in different areas, and the intended workflow for information management. The folder structure often indicates the intended use and lifecycle of different notes."

### MCP Prompts (pre-configured templates)

#### `search_notes`
**Description**: "An interactive conversation template for searching and refining queries about notes in your vault. This prompt helps AI assistants guide you through the search process, starting with understanding what you're looking for, performing the initial search, interpreting results, and suggesting refinements or related searches. It combines the search_vault tool with intelligent follow-up questions to ensure you find exactly what you need, even when you're not sure how to articulate it initially."

#### `summarize_recent`
**Description**: "A structured approach to understanding and summarizing recent activity in your vault. This prompt orchestrates multiple tools to identify what you've been working on, recognize patterns in your recent notes, highlight key themes and projects, and suggest connections between recent work. It helps maintain awareness of your knowledge work patterns and ensures important insights from recent notes aren't lost in the flow of daily work."

#### `explore_topic`
**Description**: "A comprehensive exploration workflow that deeply investigates any topic across your entire vault. This prompt doesn't just search for mentions; it builds a complete understanding by finding all relevant notes, analyzing their connections, identifying key sources and authorities, revealing gaps in coverage, and synthesizing findings into actionable insights. It's designed for when you need to fully understand everything your vault contains about a subject, whether for research, decision-making, or content creation."

#### `daily_review`
**Description**: "A systematic review process for daily notes that helps maintain knowledge hygiene and build connections. This prompt examines your daily note to extract key insights, identify tasks and commitments, suggest connections to existing notes, recommend tags and organization, and highlight items that deserve expansion into permanent notes. It transforms daily captures into integrated knowledge while maintaining the PARA method or your chosen organizational system."
