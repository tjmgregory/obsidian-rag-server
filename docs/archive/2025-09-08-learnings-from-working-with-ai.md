Building with AI: A Collaborative Project Reflection

  Project Overview

  Built an Obsidian RAG MCP server from scratch using TDD, implementing domain-driven design with Result types, performance monitoring, and comprehensive testing
  infrastructure.

  What Worked Brilliantly üéØ

  1. Pause-and-Plan Pattern

  Your decision to stop and create implementation guides (like the improvements guide) was game-changing. Instead of rushing forward, we:
  - Created structured todo lists with progress tracking
  - Built comprehensive guides that became living documents
  - Used these as checkpoints to reflect and adjust course

  Why it worked: AI excels at executing well-defined plans but can drift without structure. Your guides became our shared mental model.

  2. Documentation-Driven Development

  Writing standards BEFORE implementation was incredibly effective:
  - Testing standards defined our TDD approach upfront
  - Coding standards prevented style debates
  - Decision logs captured context for future reference

  Why it worked: AI can consistently follow documented patterns across an entire codebase, making standards incredibly powerful.

  3. Iterative Refinement with Verification

  The cycle of implement ‚Üí test ‚Üí verify ‚Üí document worked beautifully:
  - Performance benchmarks that exceeded targets by 100-600x
  - Integration tests catching real issues our mocks missed
  - Success criteria verification creating confidence

  Why it worked: AI can rapidly iterate when given clear success metrics and feedback loops.

  4. Pattern Recognition and Propagation

  When you noticed good patterns (like Result types), we could quickly:
  - Document them in standards
  - Apply them consistently across the codebase
  - Create decision logs explaining the rationale

  Why it worked: AI excels at pattern matching and consistent application once patterns are identified.

  Where We Struggled ü§î

  1. Testing Philosophy Alignment

  Early confusion about mocking strategies and test boundaries:
  - Initial over-mocking vs behavior testing
  - Mock vs real file system decisions
  - Unit vs integration test boundaries

  The fix: Your explicit testing standards document resolved this completely.

  2. Context Limitations

  Had to continue from a previous session, requiring:
  - Careful context reconstruction
  - Some repetition of work
  - Potential for drift from original intent

  The fix: Your detailed guides and documentation made continuation seamless.

  3. Tool-Specific Quirks

  - TypeScript's exactOptionalPropertyTypes causing repeated issues
  - ESM vs CommonJS confusion with commitlint
  - Biome linting preferences

  The fix: Learning and adapting to project-specific tooling choices.

  4. Convention Violations

  I didn't follow conventional commits initially despite it being documented:
  - Made a non-conventional commit message
  - You had to explicitly point this out

  The fix: Automation! Making it impossible to do wrong is better than documentation.

  Key Success Factors üí™

  What Made It Easy

  1. Your Technical Expertise: You knew when something was off and could guide corrections
  2. Clear Communication: "Can we make that automated so it's less easy to mistake?" - Direct, actionable feedback
  3. Incremental Progress: Small, verified steps rather than big leaps
  4. Trust with Verification: You let me work autonomously but verified results
  5. Reflective Checkpoints: "Why don't you commit that and then reflect on how all things have gone so far?"

  What Made It Hard

  1. Implicit Assumptions: When standards weren't documented, I sometimes made different choices
  2. Environment Differences: Some tool behaviors that work locally might differ in CI
  3. Balancing Proactivity: Knowing when to suggest improvements vs just executing
  4. Testing Depth: Finding the right level of testing without overdoing it

  Lessons for Your Team üìö

  DO's ‚úÖ

  1. Document Standards First: Every hour spent on standards saves 10 hours of revision
  2. Create Living Guides: Implementation guides with progress trackers maintain momentum
  3. Pause to Reflect: Regular checkpoints prevent drift and compound errors
  4. Automate Conventions: Don't rely on AI (or humans) to remember - enforce automatically
  5. Trust but Verify: Let AI work autonomously but validate results against criteria
  6. Preserve Context: Archive completed work with dates for future reference

  DON'Ts ‚ùå

  1. Don't Skip Documentation: Undocumented conventions will be inconsistently followed
  2. Don't Rush Forward: Pausing to plan saves more time than it costs
  3. Don't Assume AI Knows Your Preferences: Be explicit about patterns and anti-patterns
  4. Don't Ignore Small Issues: They compound - fix them immediately
  5. Don't Work Without Success Criteria: Vague goals lead to vague results

  The Magic Formula ü™Ñ

  Clear Standards
  + Living Documentation
  + Iterative Verification
  + Reflective Checkpoints
  + Automated Enforcement
  = Successful AI Collaboration

  Most Valuable Insight

  The best AI collaboration happens when you treat AI as a highly capable but literal-minded team member who needs clear direction and benefits from regular feedback 
  loops.

  Your approach of creating guides, establishing standards, and then letting me execute with verification was optimal. The improvements guide with its 11-point
  checklist that we completed 100% is a perfect example of this pattern.

  Final Thought

  The moment you asked "why didn't you use conventional commits?" and immediately followed with "can we make that automated?" captures the entire spirit of successful
  AI collaboration: identify patterns, document them, then make them impossible to violate. This project succeeded because you understood this principle intuitively.
